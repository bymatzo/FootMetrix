# FootMetrix
FootMetriX is an advanced football (soccer) GPS performance analytics app. It processes raw player data to generate tactical graphs and key metrics, transforming kinematics into actionable insights. This decision-support tool helps coaches optimize training load, assess injury risk, and refine on-field strategies

FootMetriX is a cutting-edge performance analytics application specifically designed for football (soccer) technical staff, including coaches, fitness trainers, and analysts. Our mission is to streamline the use of raw player GPS data, transforming it into concrete tactical and physical intelligence for informed decision-making. We provide a robust platform for movement visualization, standardized indicator calculation, and crucial decision support, whether in real-time or post-match.

##Key Features
  ###1. Graph Analysis & Visualization
    FootMetriX excels at the visual representation of complex data:
    
    Heatmaps: Visualization of activity zones and presence density to assess individual positioning and spatial coverage.
    
    Movement Traces: Detailed representation of running tracks, changes in direction, and speed profiles for analyzing individual and collective effort.
    
    Tactical Visualization: Overlay of player movements onto a pitch schematic for direct assessment of team cohesion and adherence to tactical instructions.
  
  ##2. Performance Indicator (KPI) Calculation
    We compute a comprehensive set of metrics to quantify player load and efficiency:
    
    Total Physical Load: Distance covered, High-Speed Running (HSR) distance, sprint count, metabolic power.
    
    Kinematics & Speed: Max speed, accumulation of acceleration/deceleration bursts, and intensity profile per game period.
    
    Key Tactical Indicators: Measurement of team compactness (length and width), positional drift, and time spent in critical areas of the pitch.
  
  ##3. Decision Support & Monitoring
    The ultimate goal is to translate data into decisions:
    
    Historical Comparisons: Benchmark a player's or the team's current performance against their own averages or predefined targets.
    
    Workload Assessment: Use Acute-to-Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) and other metrics to monitor fatigue, manage injury risk, and adjust training sessions.
    
    Synthetic Reports: Generation of clear, exportable reports for staff meetings and player debriefs.
    
    Contribution and Technologies (To be adapted)
    This project is currently under development. Contributions are welcome.
  
  ###Potential Technologies:
  
    Backend: Python (with Pandas, NumPy) for data processing.
    
    Visualization: Plotly or Matplotlib for graphs and mapping.
    
    Interface: (Specify: e.g., a web application built with React, or a desktop application.)
